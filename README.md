## About The Project
<h3 align="justify">A small web application written to optimize your working time. This idea came to me because I myself am used to writing down my working hours and making small notes while working. Also, after finishing work, I write down the overall impression of the work. I will be glad if you give me a star.</h3>  

### Built with
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,html,css,vue,vite)](https://skillicons.dev)


### Advantages of the application

- Written using the Composition API (Vue 3)

- All your data is saved to the local storage

- Theme change is available (light/dark) 

- A choice of 6 popular languages is available (implemented using the i18n library)

- Pinia storage is used

### There are plans to improve

- Process an emergency exit from the page (closing a tab, window) while saving the current data

- Add the ability to delete all sessions 

- Add the ability to delete tasks for the current day (now only the addition is implemented)

- To refactor the code
